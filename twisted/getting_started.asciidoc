== Copy and paste examples
In addition to the Hello World sample code, we also provide some copy and paste snippets of common
API functions:

=== Init
Instantiate a new Pubnub instance. Only the `subscribe_key` is mandatory. Also include `publish_key`
if you intend to publish from this instance, and the `secret_key` if you wish to perform PAM
administrative operations from this Python V4 instance.

NOTE: For security reasons you should only include the secret-key on a highly secured server. The
secret-key is only required for granting rights using our Access Manager.

[source,python]
.Initializing the client

pnconfig.subscribe_key = 'my_subscribe_key'

pnconfig.secret_key = 'my_secret_key'

pubnub = PubNub(pnconfig)

=== Listeners

==== Listeners categories

|===
| Categories | Description

|PNNetworkIssuesCategory | A subscribe event experienced an exception when running.
|PNReconnectedCategory | SDK was able to reconnect to pubnub.
|PNConnectedCategory | SDK subscribed with a new mix of channels (fired every time the channel / channel group mix changed).
|===

=== Time

[source,python]
.Call `time()` to verify the client connectivity to the origin:
----
envelope = yield pubnub.time().future()
    print('current time: %d' % envelope.result)
----

=== Subscribe

[source,python]
.Subscribe (listen on) a channel:
----
pubnub.subscribe().channels('my_channel').execute()
----

=== Publish

[source,python]
.Publish a message to a channel:
----
@gen.coroutine
def publish_snippet():
    def publish_callback(result, status):
        if not status.is_error():
            envelope = result
            pass  # Message successfully published to specified channel.
        else:
            pass  # Handle message publish error. Check 'category' property to find out possible issue
            # because of which request did fail.
            # Request can be resent using: [status retry];

    pubnub.publish().channel('such_channel').message(['hello', 'there']).async(publish_callback)
----

=== HereNow
NOTE: Requires that the `Presence` add-on is enabled for your key. How do I enable add-on features for my keys? - see http://www.pubnub.com/knowledge-base/discussion/644/how-do-i-enable-add-on-features-for-my-keys

[source,python]
.Get occupancy of who's here now on the channel:
----
@inlineCallbacks
def here_now():
    envelope = yield pubnub.here_now().channels('demo').include_uuids(True).deferred()

    if envelope.status.is_error():
        return

    for channel_data in envelope.result.channels:
        print("---")
        print("channel: %s" % channel_data.channel_name)
        print("occupancy: %s" % channel_data.occupancy)

        print("occupants: %s" % channel_data.channel_name)
        for occupant in channel_data.occupants:
            print("uuid: %s, state: %s" % (occupant.uuid, occupant.state))

----

=== Presence
Subscribe to realtime Presence events, such as `join`, `leave`, and `timeout`, by UUID. Setting the presence attribute to a callback will subscribe to presents events on `my_channel`:

NOTE: Requires that the `Presence` add-on is enabled for your key. How do I enable add-on features for my keys? - see http://www.pubnub.com/knowledge-base/discussion/644/how-do-i-enable-add-on-features-for-my-keys

[source,python]
----
pubnub.subscribe().channels('my_channel').with_presence().execute()
----

NOTE: The response of the call is handled by adding a Listener. Please see the Listeners section for
more details. Listeners should be added before calling the method.


=== History

NOTE: Requires that the `Storage and Playback` add-on is enabled for your key. How do I enable
add-on features for my keys? - see
http://www.pubnub.com/knowledge-base/discussion/644/how-do-i-enable-add-on-features-for-my-keys

[source,python]
.Retrieve published messages from archival storage:
----
@inlineCallbacks
def get_messages()
    envelope = yield pubnub.history().channel('history_channel').count(100).deferred()
    # handle messages stored at evelope.result.messages
    # status is available as envelope.status
----

=== Unsubscribe

[source,python]
.Stop subscribing(listening) to a channel:
----
pubnub.unsubscribe().channels(['my_channel', 'another_channel']).execute()
----

NOTE: The response of the call is handled by adding a Listener. Please see the Listeners section
for more details. Listeners should be added before calling the method.
